I needed a way to clean up all of the printer-*.cfg that mainsail backs up. The solution was to place a script inside of the following dir:

~/printer_data/scripts

the script is called move_backups.sh. Here is the script:

###SCRIPT START

#!/bin/bash

# --- Configuration ---
# This is the path to your Klipper configuration directory.
# Make sure this matches your setup (e.g., '~/printer_data/config').
CONFIG_DIR=~/printer_data/config

# This is the name of the subdirectory where backups will be stored.
# --- MODIFIED LINE ---
BACKUP_DIR="$CONFIG_DIR/printer_cfg-old" 

# The number of recent backup files you want to keep in the main directory.
# --- NEW ---
KEEP_COUNT=3
# --- End of Configuration ---


# Exit if the config directory doesn't exist
if [ ! -d "$CONFIG_DIR" ]; then
  echo "Error: Config directory not found at $CONFIG_DIR"
  exit 1
fi

# Create the backup directory if it doesn't already exist
echo "Checking for backup directory at $BACKUP_DIR..."
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
echo "Directory check complete."

# --- MODIFIED LOGIC ---
# List all printer.cfg backups, sort by time (newest first), skip the newest ones,
# and then move the rest to the backup directory.
echo "Keeping the $KEEP_COUNT newest backups and moving the rest..."
ls -t "$CONFIG_DIR"/printer-*.cfg 2>/dev/null | tail -n +$(($KEEP_COUNT + 1)) | xargs -I {} mv {} "$BACKUP_DIR"

echo "Backup move complete."

### SCRIPT END

I then created the    in "~/printer_data/config" called "printer_cfg-old".

Now we'll change the cron schedule from a daily timer to run once every time the Raspberry Pi starts up.

crontab -e

add the following to crontab: @reboot /bin/bash /home/pi/move_backups.sh > /dev/null 2>&1

Backup Location: Your old configurations will now be moved to ~/printer_data/config/printer_cfg-old/.

Backup Logic: The script will always leave your 3 most recent printer-*.cfg backup files in the main config folder for easy access and move all older ones.

Schedule: The script will run automatically a few moments after your Raspberry Pi boots up.
